# RSS Hamster

## Description

This is a project where I will try to create a RSS reader in Visual Studio using WinForms and ASP.Net Razor pages.
I am aiming for something similar to [Feedly](https://feedly.com/).
This idea came to be because sometimes I am so buried in algorithmic recommendations I miss updates on content I want to follow.

## File Structure

The [Documentation] folder contains the most recent version of the documentation for this project
The [RSS Reader] folder contains the VS project
